Hero Image and Transparent Nav Bar:
    Add 4-6 Elements in the nav bar that blend seamlessly
    with the image. Make them collapse into a hamburger
    menu. These won't link to other pages, rather point to sections on the website.

Hero Image Slider:
    Code the JS for an Image carousel with buttons. Make a div container that is called "container" and set all of the pictures equal to that. reference: https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-make-an-image-carousel-for-your-website/

Photo Gallery:
    Make a flexbox photo gallery that flips to show the caption. JS ansv CSS

Collapsible mobile images:
    Make all of the images under one flexbox (the section)
    Create a div ID with a header button telling the user to click to show more images. Give the buttons below an ID and a class of hidden, that has CSS of display: hidden;
    Create a JavaScript code that replaces the values of the display: hidden on click, and makes the menu visible. Then, it applies the display hidden code to the main header, and codes a new footer at the bottom telling the user to click to close.
    

JS code snippets to save:

/* align viewport position with a particular div container onclick, will scroll from bottom up: */

document.getElementById('buttonID').addEventListener('click', function() {
    var element = document.getElementById('divToAlign');
    element.scrollIntoView({behavior: "smooth", block: "start", inline: "nearest"});
});
